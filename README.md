# Data Science Assessment for Domestic and General

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for the Domestic and General data science assessment. It includes a comprehensive exploration of insurance purchase data, model development for predicting purchases, and analysis of pricing strategies.

## Files and Directories
DG Assessment.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook with the full analysis workflow.
graphs/: Directory containing visualizations generated from the data.
report/: Directory containing the summary report in Excel format.
DS_train_cleaned.csv: The cleaned dataset resulting from preprocessing steps.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment

## Python Libraries Required
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Imbalanced-learn

## Usage
To replicate the analysis:

Open DG Assessment.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run all cells in the notebook from top to bottom.

## Key Components of the Analysis
Data Preparation: Data is loaded, checked for missing values and duplicates, and dates are converted to datetime objects.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualizations are conducted to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
Feature Engineering: New features are created to enhance the model's predictive capability.
Model Building: Several classification models are trained and evaluated.
Price Elasticity Analysis: Elasticity of demand with respect to price changes is calculated.
Impact of 10% Price Increase: The effect of increasing premiums by 10% on customer acceptance probability is analyzed.

## Additional Notes
Visualizations and graphs are stored in the graphs/ directory for reference.
A detailed report summarizing the findings and insights can be found in the report/ directory.
